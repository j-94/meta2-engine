1-liner
- Treat outputs as strata; publish one crystal at a time.

context
- Multi-threaded work hides diamonds in rough; small artifacts surface them without scope creep.

pattern (3 steps)
1) Index: scan your research index; pick 5 candidates.
2) Cut: compress each into a card (A–E lanes).
3) Post: ship two; log signals; route next picks.

evidence
- Receipts from meta loop; golden diffs; engagement signals.

CTA
- Open a `field/` folder and add one card per day; let the feed be the multilane field.
