1-liner
- Choose the simplest artifact that proves the loop.

context
- Grand systems stall when you can’t ship; one tiny, working loop reroutes momentum.

pattern (3 steps)
1) Define one loop (plan→act→verify→stop) and a single success metric.
2) Remove every step that doesn’t change the metric.
3) Ship; let feedback pick the next smallest improvement.

CTA
- Pick one artifact today: post a field card or wire one verify-first check.
